- Project Detail
  - This project is inspired by a book named "[In search of memory](https://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=In_Search_of_Memory)", a book about the neurological principles of human learning. Let's look at the picture below:

  This picture is the part of mechanism of long-term memory in biological, I extracted the function of neures to code of this project.
  - I have implemented long-term-memory mechanisms and visualized it for now. But still have no idea about how to use these mechanisms to implement the whole process of human mind.
  - Here is the picture of visualization running on golang:
